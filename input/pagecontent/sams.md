### Simple Assessment Modules (SAMS)

#### PIQI Assessment Approach

The PIQI Framework assesses patient data in the PIQI Data Model using an **Evaluation Rubric**.

The Evaluation Rubric is a sequenced collection of **Evaluation Criteria**.

Each Evaluation Criteria is comprised of a specific **PIQI Model Entity** an assigned **Evaluation** an optional **Condition** and the **Scoring Effect.**

The PIQI Model Entity can be an attribute, element, data class or the entire patient.

The **Evaluation** and **Condition** are both configured **Simple Assessment Modules** (**SAMs**).

If the **Condition** is configured, the **Evaluation** is only processed if the conditional SAM passes.

Each Evaluation that is processed triggers the **Scoring Effect** based upon the pass or fail result of the underlying SAM. If the SAM returns an indeterminant result (could not assess) the Evaluation is skipped. This implies a condition within the implementation of the SAM itself was not met.

#### Simple Assessment Modules

Simple assessment modules (SAMs) are composable service endpoints that follow a consistent interface pattern, evaluate a patient message, data class, element or attribute and return a simple "pass", "fail" or "skip" result. Given that interaction with a PIQI evaluation endpoint is at the Rubric level, and not at the SAM level, the actual format for conveying these responses (e.g., "pass/fail" vs. "true/false" vs. "1/0") is an implementation decision that is outside the scope of this standard.

### Anatomy of a Simple Assessment Module (SAM)

A SAM is comprised of the following component:

#### SAM Mnemonic

The SAMID is a mnemonic identifier that is used to identify a unique SAM. The Mnemonic is intended to be universal so that common SAMs can be referenced across implementations in the PIQI community. This is the primary identifier to reference a given SAM.

#### SAM UID

The SAMUID is an optional implementation specific unique identifier. This identifier can vary from implementation to implementation.

#### SAM Name

The name of the SAM. This name should be in the context of the SAM passing. For example, if the SAM is assessing if a attribute is populated the same name would be ‘Is populated’.

#### SAM Success Alias

The alias for the SAM that is used when communicating that the SAM has passed. For example, in the SAM name is ‘Attribute is populated’ the SAM Success Alias would be ‘Is populated’.

#### SAM Failure Alias

The alias for the SAM that is used when communicating that the SAM has failed. This is typically the reciprocal of the SAM Success Alias. For example, in the SAM name is ‘Is populated’ the SAM Failure Alias would be ‘Is not populated’.

#### SAM Description

This is a brief description of the purpose of the SAM.

#### SAM Input Type

This is the entity type that the SAM expects as input. The initial Input types are as follows:

**Simple_Attribute** A simple string attribute JSON string

**Codeable_Concept_Attribute** A codeable concept attribute JSON string

**Observation_Value** a observation value JSON string

**Ranged_Value** A ranged value JSON string

**Element** A domain element JSON collection

**Data_Class** A domain data class, element JSON collection

**Patient** The entire patient JSON collection

For the Element and Data Class input Types the PIQI Model is required.

#### SAM PIQI Model

SAMs that use elements as input types will have a requirement to specify the minimum PIQI model and minimum version that is required to provide the SAM with the necessary attribute components in the body of the element. It has the following components:

##### PIQI Model Mnemonic

The standard mnemonic for the PIQI model

##### PIQI Model Version

The numeric version of the PIQI Model

##### PIQI Model Mnemonic

The mnemonic for the specific standard model version.

#### SAM Parameters

This is a list of parameters that the SAM accepts each parameter has multiple components:

##### SAM Parameter Name

This is the name of the parameter in the parameter. This name is used in in the parameter JSON that is passed to the SAM.

##### SAM Parameter Description

This is the description of the nature and purpose of the parameter.

##### SAM Parameter Type

This is the parameter type and can be one of the following values. The specific parameter types can be used to simplify SAM configuration. All SAM parameters are passed to the SAM as a JSON collection on execution.

**Code_System_Identifier** A code system or value set identifier

**Demographic_Attribute** A patient demographic attribute

**Content_Asset_Mnemonic** A defined content asset in the content library

**Simple_Text_Parameter** A simple free text vale.

#### SAM Prerequisite SAM Mnemonic

This is the SAM Mnemonic for the SAM that must pass before this SAM can run. This is an optional property.

#### SAM HDQT Dimension Mnemonic

This defined the healthcare data quality taxonomy dimension that this SAM is bound to. The mnemonic is from the HDQT dimension list.

#### SAM Execution Type

This defines the nature of the machinery of the SAM and can have the following values.

**Primitive_Logic** The execution is primitive logic that is hard wired into the PIQI Framework.

**Regex_Pattern** The execution is primitive logic that uses regex to match reference data

**Stored_Procedure** The execution is using a SQL stored procedure.

**RESTful_Service** The execution is calling a RESTful service.

**Value_Set_Enum** The execution is using a Value Set on enumerated strings

**Value_Set_Code** The execution is using a value set of codings

For the Stored_Procedure and RESTful_Service execution types the assumption is they have an interface that matches the SAM interface for the input type. These execution types are designed to support SAMs requiring more advanced logic or semantic relationships that could be powered by an Integrated Knowledge Environment such as those described in the Tinkar specification in [HL7 Logical Model: Standardized Terminology Knowledgebase, Release 1](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=573).

#### SAM Execution Reference

This is the meta-data that describes the information necessary to execute the SAM based on the execution type.

- If the execution type is Primitive_Logic, this property is blank.
- If the execution type is Stored_Procedure, this would be the stored procedure name.
- If the execution type is RESTful_Service, this would be the URL for the RESTful service endpoint.
- If the execution type is Value_Set, this would be the value set identifier in the repository.

#### SAM Creation DateTime

The date and time the SAM was created. This is optional for primitive SAMs.

#### SAM Modification DateTime

The date and time the SAM was last updated.

#### SAM Source

The author of the SAM and related reference resources. This is optional for primitive SAMs.

##### Source Name

The name of the source of the SAM

##### PIQI Alliance Member UID

The PIQI Alliance Member unique identifier.

    ]
}
```

### Standard Simple Assessment Modules

The standard SAMs are those that operate against attributes that use primitive logic for performance.

#### Simple Attribute SAMs

A **simple attribute** is a string value in the JSON attribute structure. Simple Attributes can contain any string and can be used to represent any single basic data type like text, simple numbers, structured numbers and dates.

Example: In this example the EffectiveDateTime attribute is a simple attribute.

```json
{
    "labElements": [
        {"effectiveDateTime": "20230111135518"}
    ]
}
```

For the purposes of a SAM complex attribute type like Codeable Concepts, Ranged Values and Observation values can be treated like simple attributes.

A **codeable concept** attribute is a structure that can be represented as a simple attribute or a coded entity. Many attributes in patient data can be represented by a coded entity or a simple code value and as such is represented by a text sub-attribute and a codings collection.

**Example:** In this Test example the highlighted text is considered the simple attribute value of the codeable concept.

```json
{
    "test": {
        "text": "MONOCYTES:NCNC:PT:BLD:QN:AUTOMATED COUNT",
        "codings": [
            {
                "code": "742-7",
                "display": "MONOCYTES:NCNC:PT:BLD:QN:AUTOMATED COUNT",
                "system": "LOINC"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Each complex attribute has a similar **text** field at the root level of its JSON structure. This **text** value is what is assessed by **simple attribute** SAMs.

The most common simple attribute SAM is ‘**Is Populated**’ which is used as a prerequisite for many downstream SAMs.

##### Attribute is Populated

#### Codeable Concept SAMs

A Codeable Concept attribute is a structure that can be represented as a simple attribute or a coded entity. Many attributes in patient data can be represented by a coded entity or a simple code value and as such is represented by a text sub-attribute and a codings collection.

**Codeable Concept sub-attributes**

| **AttributeName** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| text | Simple Attribute | Text representation of the concept |
| codings | Codings | Collection of zero-to-many codings |

**Coding sub-attributes**

| **AttributeName** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | Simple Attribute | Code value for the coded concept |
| display | Simple Attribute | Display value for the coded concept |
| system | Simple Attribute | Code system identifier for the codec concept |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "test": {
        "text": " MONOCYTES, Serum",
        "codings": [
            {
                "code": "MONO100",
                "display": "MONOS",
                "system": "LCL"
            },
            {
                "code": "742-7",
                "display": "MONOCYTES:NCNC:PT:BLD:QN:AUTOMATED COUNT",
                "system": "LOINC"
            },
            {
                "code": "123456789",
                "display": "MONOCYTES, Serum",
                "system": ""
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

For SAMs assessing **codeable concepts**, the coding collection is critical and is assessed as an aggregate. Since a **codeable concept** attribute can have more than one code in the **codings** collection an assessment is evaluating the entire collection looking for the best-case scenario.

In the above example there are three **codings** in the collection. The SAMs that assess the **codings** like **has code**, **has code system** and **has display** provide the best-case scenario based on all of the **codings**. So, for the above example each of those SAMs would pass. The **Is Complete** assesses if at least **one coding** has all three parts. So, it would also pass because the second **coding** is complete. The **Is Valid Member** SAM would take the code system from each complete coding and attempt to validate that coding using the terminology server. If the code system is published to the terminology server and the code is valid it would also pass. The **Is Compatible** SAM with the LOINC parameter would also pass since at least one of the codings in the collection is valid and has a recognized representation of the LOINC code system.

It is also worth noting that **Codeable Concepts SAMs** also work with **Observation Value** attributes since they can contain a **codings** collection.

#### Observation Value SAMs

An **Observation Value** attribute is a structure that can be represented as a simple attribute value or a structure observation value. **Observation Value** is a specialized attribute as many elements in patient information can be represented by quantitative, text or coded concepts value. It is important to remember that simple attribute SAMs, codeable concept SAMs and range value SAMs can all be applied to an **Observation Value** attribute

**Observation Value sub-attributes**

| **AttributeName** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| text | Simple Attribute | Text representation of the value |
| type | Codeable Concept | Collection of zero-to-many coded concepts representing the value type |
| number | Simple Attribute | For numeric values |
| number2 | Simple Attribute | For second numeric value – used for structured numrics like ranges and ratios |
| codings | Codeable Concept | Collection of zero-to-many coded concepts representing the observation value |

Example:

```json
{
    "resultValue": {
        "text": "Abnormal",
        "number": "",
        "number2": "",

#### Element SAMs

An Element is a data class specific collection of attributes based on the PIQI Data Model specification. An Element SAMs has an input type that is the JSON for that element including all of its constituent attributes and audit information for those attributes.

While most attribute SAMs are primitive, it is expected that element level attributes will be based on content and require that the constituent attribute SAMs have passed.

Here are some examples of Element SAMs.

##### Element is Clean

This SAM is designed to assess if an element constituent attribute SAMs have all passed. The term ‘Clean’ in PIQI parlance means that all of the scoring evaluations for something have passed.

##### Condition Is Sex Plausible

This SAM is designed to assess if a condition is plausible based on the birth sex from the patient demographics. It would also assume the condition code in the element is coded to SNOMEDCT.

| **Property** | **Value** |

#### Data Class SAMs

A **Data Class** represents a domain specific collection of attributes that are instantiated in Elements. A **Data Class** SAM is intended to evaluate scenarios across its collection of elements. Typically, this type of SAM is used to identify inconsistency, duplication or disjoint conditions.

Here is an example of **Data Class** SAM.

##### Data Class Has Duplicates

This SAM is designed to assess if a **Data Class** collection has duplicates. The attributes used to identify duplication are passed in the parameters.

| **Property** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |

#### Patient Message SAMs

A SAM that evaluates the entire patient message, including all of its data classes and elements, is contemplated in the PIQI Framework. This type of SAM can be used to look for gaps in information and other message level plausibility concerns. Careful consideration should be given to this type of SAM as the message payload JSON could be quite large and could significantly impact the performance of the gateway. SAMs that perform **Data Class** specific assessments but require patient information should be element level SAMs that use a patient demographics parameter. (see [Condition is Sex Plausible](#condition-is-sex-plausible) example)

Here is an example of a patient level SAM.

##### Patient is Undocumented Diabetic

This SAM is designed to process the patient message with a multi-data class inference that determines if the patient has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus based on labs, medications and comorbidities, but does have no mention of Diabetes on their condition list. This SAM would return a ‘condition not met’ if the patient has diabetes in their conditions list or does meet the criteria for the evaluation.

| **Property** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| SAM Mnemonic | Patient_IsUndocumentedDiabetic |
| Success Alias | Is undocumented diabetic |
| Failure Alias | Is not undocumented diabetic |
